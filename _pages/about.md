Hi! My name is Ran Tao (陶然). I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu/). I’m fortunate to be advised by [Yu Gu](https://www.math.umd.edu/~ygu7/). Before that, I got my B.S. degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at [Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm) in 2019.

My research focuses on probability and stochastic analysis, with their applications to statistical physics. I work on topics including stochastic partial differential equations, interacting particle systems, and Malliavin calculus.

I am on the 2024-2025 postdoc job market!
