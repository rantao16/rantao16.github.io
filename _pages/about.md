Hi! My name is Ran Tao (陶然). From Aug 2025 to Dec 2025, I will be a postdoc in the pogram of Recent Trends in Stochastic Partial Differential Equations at [Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (SLMath)](https://www.slmath.org/programs/380#overview_programs). I got my Ph.D. from the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu/) in May 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Yu Gu](https://www.math.umd.edu/~ygu7/). Before that, I got my B.S. degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences at [Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/mathen/main.htm) in 2019.

My research focuses on probability and stochastic analysis, with their applications to statistical physics. I work on topics including stochastic partial differential equations, interacting particle systems, and Malliavin calculus.

Here is a copy of my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QAnjKtOeVYARGnoyFWeTqpMsvxPqjKny/view?usp=sharing).
